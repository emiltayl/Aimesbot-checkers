Aimesbot Checkers
Emil T. Bye's contribution to http://arkt.is/checkers/ (in Norwegian), a
checkers AI competition.

Disclaimer: Much of the code is ugly, mostly because I've tried to be "smart"
and write code that is _supposed_ to be as efficient as possible. This is not a
good idea, but the purpose with this competition is not to write "good" code,
but to hack something together and hope for the best.

Feel free to use this code for whatever you'd like, as long as it's something
nice.
