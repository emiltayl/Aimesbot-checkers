Aimesbot Checkers
Emil T. Bye's contribution to http://arkt.is/checkers/ (in Norwegian), a
checkers AI competition.

Disclaimer: Much of the code is ugly, mostly because I've tried to be "smart"
and write code that is supposed to be as efficient as possible. This is
generally not a good idea, but the purpose with this competition is not to write
"good" code.

Generally you can use this code for whatever you'd like, as long as it's
something nice.
